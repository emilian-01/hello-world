	<h1>Extreme Sports</h1>
	
	<p id="exSp" class="parag">
		The origin of the divergence of the term "extreme sports" from "sports" 
		may date to the 1950s in the appearance of a phrase usually, but wrongly, 
		attributed to Ernest Hemingway. The phrase is "There are only three sports: 
		bullfighting, motor racing, and mountaineering; all the rest are merely games.
		"The implication of the phrase was that the word "sport" defined an activity 
		in which one might be killed. The other activities being termed "games". 
		The phrase may have been invented by either writer Barnaby Conrad or 
		automotive author Ken Purdy. The Dangerous Sports Club of Oxford University, 
		England was founded by David Kirke, Chris Baker, Ed Hulton and Alan Weston. 
		They first came to wide public attention by inventing modern day bungee jumping, 
		by making the first modern jumps on 1 April 1979, from the Clifton Suspension Bridge, 
		Bristol, England. They followed the Clifton Bridge effort with a jump from 
		the Golden Gate Bridge in San Francisco, California (including the first female 
		bungee jump by Jane Wilmot), and with a televised leap from the Royal GorgeSuspension 
		Bridge in Colorado, sponsored by and televised on the popular American television 
		program That's Incredible! Bungee jumping was treated as a novelty for a few years, 
		then became a craze for young people, and is now an established industry for thrill seekers. 
		The Club also pioneered a surrealist form of skiing, holding three events at 
		St. Moritz,Switzerland, in which competitors were required to devise a sculpture 
		mounted on skis and ride it down a mountain. The event reached its limits when the 
		Club arrived in St. Moritz with a London double-decker bus, wanting to send it down
		the ski slopes, and the Swiss resort managers refused. Other Club activities included 
		expedition hang gliding from active volcanoes; the launching of giant (60 ft) plastic 
		spheres with pilots suspended in the centre (zorbing); microlightflying; and BASE jumping
		(in the early days of this sport). In recent decades the term extreme sport was further
		promoted after the Extreme Sports Channel, Extreme.com launched and then the X Games, 
		a multi-sport event was created and developed by ESPN. The first X Games (known as 1995
		Extreme Games) were held in Newport, Providence, Mount Snow, and Vermont in the United States.

		Adventure Sports and Extreme Sports - also called Action Sports - are not like mainstream sports. 
		They are crawling with rebels, riders, drivers and rock stars. It's not about uniforms, 
		coaches or scripts. Expressing yourself through action is the key, it's an attitude, a way of life,
		even a religion. Once you're in, you're in for life.
