	<h3>ENTERTAINING, INSPIRING AND ACTIVATING THROUGH ACTION SPORTS, ADVENTURE AND FUN.</h3>
	<p>
		Snowboarder drops off a cornice. A feature of such activities in the view of some is their alleged capacity to induce an adrenaline 
		rush in participants.However, the medical view is that the rush or high associated with the activity is not due to adrenaline being 
		released as a response to fear, but due to increased levels of dopamine, endorphins and serotonin because of the high level of 
		physical exertion. Furthermore, a recent study suggests that the link to adrenaline and 'true' extreme sports is tentative.The 
		study defined 'true' extreme sports as a leisure or recreation activity where the most likely outcome of a mismanaged accident 
		or mistake was death. This definition was designed to separate the marketing hype from the activity. Eric Brymer also found that 
		the potential of various extraordinary human experiences, many of which parallel those found in activities such as meditation, was 
		an important part of the extreme sport experience. Those experience put the participants outside their comfort zone and are often 
		done in conjunction with adventure travel. Some of the sports have existed for decades and their proponents span generations, some 
		going on to become well known personalities. Rock climbing and ice climbing have spawned publicly recognizable names such as Edmund 
		Hillary, Chris Bonington, Wolfgang GÃ¼llichand more recently Joe Simpson. Another example is surfing, invented centuries ago by the 
		inhabitants of Hawaii.

		Rock climbing and ice climbing have spawned publicly recognizable names such as Edmund Hillary, Chris Bonington, Wolfgang Gullich 
		and more recently Joe Simpson. Another example is surfing, invented centuries ago by the inhabitants of Polynesia, it will become
		national sport of Hawaii.
		Disabled people participate in extreme sports. Nonprofit organizations such as Adaptive Action Sports seek to increase awareness
		of the participation in action sports by members of the disabled community, as well as increase access to the adaptive 
		technologies that make participation possible and to competitions such as The X Games.
